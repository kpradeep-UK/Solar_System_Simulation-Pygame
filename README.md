# Solar_System_Simulation-Pygame
This Pygame project simulates the solar system, displaying the sun and planets with realistic distances and speeds, scaled down for visibility. Each planet orbits around the sun with its own speed, providing a dynamic visualization of the solar system.
This is a Pygame-based simulation of the solar system, showing the orbits of the planets around the sun.

## Features

- Realistic orbital speeds and distances (scaled down for visibility)
- Smooth animations with adjustable frame rate
